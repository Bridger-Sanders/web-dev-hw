      <p>
        I grew up on a wheat farm near <em>Richland Montana</em> where there isn't much in terms of neighbors or entertainment value.
        I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do in life, I assumed I would be the one to take over the farm eventually.
        That slowly changed as I got older and attend school, people and activities tend to influence how we develop after all.
        It's not hard to figure out what you enjoy doing, the hard part is figuring out how to make a career out of it.
        Most of my prefered time spent in high school was used creating things for art classes as well as recording and editing footage for my media class.
        Since that was the kind of stuff I found myself amused with, I attended film school at <em>Montana State University</em> after I graduated high school.
        I later found that I didn't enjoy film as much as I thought I would, I wanted something more versatile.
        That revelation is what lead me to transfer to the <em>Univeristy of Montana</em>, Media Arts was more suitable to me.
        That brings me to the present, I only have a couple more semesters left before I graduate and pursue a career.
        Optimistically, I would prefer an occupation that revolves around animation and illustration.
