# Assignment 2
## Bridger Sanders
I'm taking this class because it's not only required to fulfill as a digital
media arts student, but also to prove to myself I can do it. As much as I find
typing tedious and sometimes strenuous, I think learning html will prove
invaluable as a foundation to build off of. Another reason is, this class may
also help with future classes I take as well as projects. Plus it doesn't hurt
to have any form of knowledge, you never know when you might need it.
### 3 things I've learned
I've learned how data travels on the internet, how to utilize headings, and the
difference between absolute and relative URL.
