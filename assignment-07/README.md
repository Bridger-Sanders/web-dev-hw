13. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.
- divs are a block that help organize and give structure to other elements for
developers.
- classes are attributes that are a longer, but concise description of similar
elements they have grouped together.
- ids are unique identifier for a specific element that is effectively
descriptive, but concise as possible.
- spans are like a sub layer to the div, spans also require a class to help
describe the itself within the div.
14. What is "alt text," and why do we use it?

representation of an image that is displayed through the image element. It's
used to help describe the image for the visually impaired.
