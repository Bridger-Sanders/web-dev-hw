        S<i>tunningly</i>, I don't really have a favorite author or anything along those lines,
        I'm not one to read recreationally or religiously unless I have to.
        Consider me boring, but I was once told only boring people get bored.
        This brings me to say I don't get bored, we all have a brain occupied with thoughts,
        and I recommend just thinking about stuff. Daydreaming and planning is a precious activity,
        and we all have our interests. For instance, I may like playing basketball but watching it disinterests me.
        Whereas someone may or may not play basketball, but they might like watching it.

        I <i>am</i> not going to shame anyone's interests unless it's morally frowned upon.
        Someone may like to hunt, but poaching and massacring animals isn't an acceptable
        pass time. There are lines that should not be crossed for a reason.
        It's necessary for things to be regulated efficiently and fairly, and stepping
        over the line is taboo. Still, it's definitely a good idea to question things because rules can also
        be too strict. Keep in mind that facts, logic, and clever analogies make for a good
        argument. I'm not the best at constructing a solid argument,
        but there's some natural silver-tongued devils out there that can fill that role.

        R<i>eturning</i> to the main point, I don't have an interest in politicians, celebrities,
        authors, or anyone of significant importance. I might prefer one over the other,
        but I'm not going to put them on a pedestal. All of this may seem strange,
        but we all grow up a certain way and that's just how it is.
        I grew up on a farm in the middle of nowhere, making entertainment quite limited.
        My interests became bound to outside activity, animals, and bottom tier electronics.
        Internet was also restricted to dial-up, not to mention I was just a child trying to
        grasp the foundation of the inevitable technological advances. My education growing up wasn't substantial either, but you make do with what you got.
        In the end, I think our interests are developed through what we have access too.
