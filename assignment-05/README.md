13. How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?
- It seems you only need one head and one body, what they contain is another matter. The head has features like; the charset, description, and author. The head holds invisible meta data and information about the site. The body has features such as; headings, paragraph's, breaks, and lists. The body contains all the contents visible to clients.
14. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.
- Structural markup is the foundation of the document which visually guides the client and provides them with information. Semantic markup practically just emphasizes, cites, and quotes words and phrases.
15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
- I reviewed all the requirements and went back & forth between the main website and the instructions for the assignment step by step.
