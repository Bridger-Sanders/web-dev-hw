13. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting,
or difficult to learn?
- Setting up the main document elements and meta elements is pretty familiar.
- Nav elements were new and style elements seemed a little more in depth.
- The expansive amount of options for styling is staggering.
- Everything is difficult to remember, I'm constantly looking at references.
14. Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate"
HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new
section?
- I guess I get to learn more about styling.
15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
- I watched the example video, read through the list of requirements, and
referenced the main website for help. Honestly, I'm gonna have to bookmark all
these html & css terms cause I have a hard time understanding what's what.
