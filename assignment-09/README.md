13. Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
- Universal affects everything,
element selector affects different elements,
class selector affects different element classes,
and id selector affects different unique id's.
- Sometimes you want everything to follow a certain style, so you choose universal.
However, when you want to tweak little things for certain code types without affect other code types you want to use element, class, and id selectors.

15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
- So I made the assignment 9 folder with everything it contained and looked up some images.
I watched the video tutorial, wrote a bunch a gibberish about decisions,
spent several hours reading over the main website,
and spent another several hours trying to make my garbage website look good.
