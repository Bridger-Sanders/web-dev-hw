- System fonts are mostly not web safe and are exported as images.
- Web fonts are custom made and hosted on a server.
- Web-safe font's are on the clients computer which can help increase loading times.

15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
- I read through the requirements, wrote some stuff since I don't read for fun, and
then I went to google to find fonts to use. Next I used the example as a guide to slowly construct my style.css.
Lastly, I double checked to make sure I fulfilled all the requirements.
