    Robert Frost was born on planet earth, probably somewhere in North America or Europe
    sometime in the 1900s or something. I should probably look up his biography, but that
    takes the fun out of it. I'm pretty sure he was a fairly famous poet, I mean the name
    "Robert Frost" just has a nice ring to it. I want to say he didn't have a pleasant upbringing
    because why would anyone want to write dark depressing stuff if they were happy?
    Hopefully, his success brought him happiness in the end, that's all anyone could ask for.
