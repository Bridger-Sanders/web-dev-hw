        We're not limited to just two options, especially where creativity's involved.
        <br>
        Can you imagine if we were all just another cog in the wheel or brick in the wall?
        <br>
        Sure you can, we've all probably felt like that at some point.
        <br>
        Maybe some of us still feel that way, but it's just how we live our lives sometimes.
        <br>
        We're all dealt our cards at birth, then depending on external forces we shape ourselves over time.
        <br>
        Change is inevitable, whether it's politics, economics, climate, catastrophe, survival, etc.
        <br>
        Just as the world shapes us, some of us want to shape the world, why do you think we have flat earthers?
        <br>
        We all have similar and differing opinions, usually we are inclined to follow one of the few majorities on a stance.
        <br>
        And as dangerous as that sounds, we have to weigh things out, simply who are these majorities composed of?
        <br>
        Do they have experience first hand, do they simply pick a side that suits their wants and needs, or do they join the bandwagon to save face?
        <br>
        Life is one huge mystery, how much do we really know about existence?
        <br>
        Some say their deity created all that we percieve and others believe there is more to it than that.
        <br>
        Simplicity and complexity, one of the many components of life that influences our decisions.
        <br>
        Some of us are comfortable whereas others may not share that sentiment, and there are many of us out there.
        <br>
        Actions and consequences, shall we ignore what doesn't affect us or should we make waves despite opposing turmoil?
