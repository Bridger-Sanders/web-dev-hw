# Bridger Sanders
This is my super impressive first webpage, and if this doesn't make you
petrified with awe, then you are completely entitled to that opinion.
However, I will not stand for any mockery, I will simply stay seated at my desk
continuing my task to type a paragraph worthy of admiration. Behold, half of
paragraph needed to persuade you that my first webpage is amazing just as it is
awesome. Imagine writing words just to validate yourself to someone you don't even
know, incredible, yet foolish. Indeed this first webpage may not be great, but
this is just the beginning of what is to come, be prepared to be as meek as possible!
