13. Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?
- A flower shop, simple, big, and user friendly.
14. What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?
- Inline only uses the minimum amount of horizontal space, has no gaps vertically,
doesn't create new lines, and disregards margins.
- Inline-block expands horizontally so element width must be set manually, also
inline-block doesn't ignore vertical spacing and margin rules.
- Block elements can overwrite inline elements or turn block elements into inline
or inline-block elements.
15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
- I read through the requirements and slowly made progress along the way to fulfill
each one while referencing tutorial video and main website.
